# Python-Project
This is a place holder for a python project that is data-science related that I'm currently brainstorming for.
More details to come!

Key targets I want to achieve: 
- Create a neatly deployed project
- Have decent documentation so that I could come back and update easily every now and then
- Be professional and consistent in the workflow
- Make a innovative and applicable project for myself
